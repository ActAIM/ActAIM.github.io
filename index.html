    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
When humans perform a task with an articulated
object, they interact with the object only in a handful of ways,
while the space of all possible interactions is nearly endless. This
is because humans have prior knowledge about what interactions
are likely to be successful, i.e., to open a new door we first
try the handle. While learning such priors without supervision
is easy for humans, it is notoriously hard for machines. In
this work, we tackle unsupervised learning of priors of useful
interactions with articulated objects, that we call interaction
modes. In contrast to the prior art, we use no supervision or
privileged information; we only assume access to the depth
sensor in the simulator to learn the interaction modes. More
precisely, we define a successful interaction as the one changing
the visual environment substantially, and learn a generative
model of such interactions, that can be conditioned on the desired
goal state of the object. In our experiments, we show that our
model covers most of the human interaction modes, outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods for affordance learning, and can
generalize to objects never seen during training. Additionally,
we show promising results in the goal-conditional setup, where
our model can be quickly fine-tuned to perform a given task.
We show in the experiments that such affordance learning
predicts interaction which covers most modes of interaction
for the querying articulated object and can be fine-tuned to a
goal-conditional model.
